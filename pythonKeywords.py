Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and predefined functions in the Python programming language. These keywords
are part of the Python language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names). 

Some key points about Python keywords:
1. Python has a set of 35 keywords (as of Python 3.9) that are predefined and reserved for specific tasks.
2. Keywords are case-sensitive in Python.
3. These keywords have specific roles and meanings within the language and should not be used for any other purpose.
4. Examples of Python keywords include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `True`, `False`, `None`, etc.

Here is a list of Python keywords:
```
False     await     else      import    pass
None      break     except    in        raise
True      class     finally   is        return
and       continue  for       lambda    try
as        def       from      nonlocal  while
assert    del       global    not       with
async     elif      if        or        yield
```

Remember that using these keywords for any other purpose will result in a syntax error in Python. It is important to recognize and understand these keywords when working with Python programming to avoid conflicts and errors in code.
